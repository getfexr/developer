# Sign in and Sign up flow with Fexr

### Step 1: Get Fexr (one for everything)

Fexr app function as a gateway for your identity in blockchain to be used as your identity for privacy essential applications. **Your lite wallet (Fexr app in your phone) communicates via RPC protocol to main wallet which connects to other validators and nodes in the blockchain**. Main wallets are provided as service or free by different subnet providers in Fexr community.

### Step 2: Create your Identity on Blockchain

Private key never leaves the device unless you export or backup it manually**. Then app will ask you to choose a provider to host your main wallet. Some providers allow faster syncing and transaction at a monthly fare paid anually. Subnets vary on geographical location and bandwidth. You can look into stats of all the subnets on [Rubix Explorer](https://rubixexplorer.com).


### Step 3: Prepare your app to validate

This allows anyone to verify your signature and ownership themselves, without requiring your credentials. You may use `Sign in with Fexr` option in other apps to authenticate yourself to their service. At any point, services can verify your identity by validating the signatures you signed for them via Fexr app.
