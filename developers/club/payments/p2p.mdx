P2P Payments or Peer to Peer Payments is the transfer of token between nodes in a network. The payments are said to be peer to peer because there is no intermediary involved during the transfer. Only the sender node and the receiver node are the only participants in the transaction. The transaction is verified by the quorum nodes in the network. The legitimacy of the transaction can be verified by anyone in the network.
A node in the context of a Blockchain usually refers to a device that downloads the appropriate cryptocurrency software to connect to a network between partners.The nodes are the individual parts of the largest data structure that is a blockchain. As node owners voluntarily contribute their computing resources to store and validate transactions.
