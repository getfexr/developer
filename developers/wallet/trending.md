Fexr celebrates and encourage businesses and validators to do well on the platform. Validator subnets that have the highest number of successful transactions and businesses that have the highest number of subscribers are listed on the **Trending** page.

Trending is the best way to increase your business or validator's visibility on Fexr. You can view trending businesses and validators by clicking on the **Trending** button on the top left of the **Explore** page.

We use the following criteria to determine the trending businesses and validators:

- No. of recent subscribers
- No. of recent transactions
- No. of recently joined validators to the subnet
- No. of recently left validators from the subnet
