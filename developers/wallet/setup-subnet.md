## What are Web3 subnets?

Core idea of Web3 is decentralized ownership, this cannot be made possible without user owning their data. Web3 subnets are the way you can create a decentralized database for your business or validator. You can create a subnet for your business or validator and manage it using the Fexr.Club platform.

A blockchain (Web3) subnet is a group of validators that are responsible for validating transactions exclusively on a subgroup within parent blockchain network. Subnets are used to increase the security of the blockchain network by dividing the network into smaller groups, each group store only a transactions they validate within their subnet. Subnets are also used to increase the throughput of the blockchain network by dividing the network into smaller groups. Each subnet carry out transactions in parallel and the throughput of the blockchain network increases.
