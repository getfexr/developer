Fexr provides a unique and cryptographically secure way to authenticate users on the web and mobile. A platform that allows users to authenticate on the web and mobile using their blockchain address. This page explains the steps to set up blockchain based authentication on available protocols using your Fexr wallet application.

Address is created one time when you create your wallet. This address is published over other peers in IPFS network for decentralised verification of the ownership of your address. Private key associated with this address is stored in your device and is never shared with anyone. This private key is used to sign the authentication request within the Fexr wallet.

## Why Fexr uses Web3?

With powerful devices and connectivity, internet has evolved but limited to handful of companies who can decide what you can see and do online. Web3 is a new internet that is decentralized, open and free. It is a new internet that is owned by no one and everyone. Traceable, transparent and secure. It is a new internet that is built on distributed ledger technology.

### What data do I need to authenticate someone?

Only the public address of the user and associated signature of the user on the content is required to authenticate them. This address is published over IPFS network for decentralised verification of the ownership of your address.

Signature is the proof that the user has signed the content with their private key. This signature is publically verifiable and can be verified by anyone. This means your data is not seen by anyone and only signature used to verify the authenticity of the user.

### How to set up Web3 Authentication on your website?

Your website or app hosted anywhere can use Fexr plugins to setup Web3 authentication. Fexr provides plugins for web and mobile. You can use these plugins to authenticate users on your website or app. More details on how to use these plugins can be found [here](/developers/category/web3-rpcs-api)
