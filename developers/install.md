Your address on the blockchain is your identity. This page explains how to create your address and connect a subnet provider to maintain availability of your address and blockchain transactions without going to a traditional exchange.

## Install Fexr Wallet for your device

Fexr Wallet is a mobile app that allows you to create and manage your address on the blockchain. You can download the app from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/fexr-wallet/id1631128786) or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.getfexr.core).

## Connect a Blockchain Subnet Provider

A blockchain subnet provider is a service that allows you to create and manage your address on the blockchain. You can connect to a subnet provider at the time of creating your address or later from the Fexr app.

## Connect to your own hot wallet with Sky

Sky is a blockchain subnet provider tool that allows you to create and manage your address on the blockchain. All user connection requests are routed through the Sky server. You can download the Sky server for [M1 Mac](https://github.com/getfexr/sky/releases/download/0.1.0/fexrsky-amd64-darwin) or [Windows](https://github.com/getfexr/sky/releases/download/0.1.0/fexrsky-amd64.exe) or [Linux](https://github.com/getfexr/sky/releases/download/0.1.0/fexrsky-386-linux). You can also connect to a Sky server hosted by Fexr partners or become a subnet provider yourself.

Once installed, you can connect your hot wallet wth Sky by running the following command:

```bash
fexr otp
```

use this OTP to connect your wallet with Sky using the public IP of your server or computer system.


## For Subnet Providers: Install Fexr Sky

You can use Sky to provide a service to Fexr users by allowing them to communicate to blockchain using your servers. You can join the club by filling out this [form](https://getfexr.com/apply). We will get back to you with more details.

## Ready to do transfers

Once you have your address, you can start doing transfers. You can also use the Fexr app to manage your address and do transfers. You can also use the `Fexr` SDK for Javascript (NPM), Python (PyPi), Rust (Crates) and Flutter (Pub.dev) to integrate Fexr into your app.

We have launched on Rubix L1 Blockchain Platform and are working on integrating with other blockchains. You can read more about the Rubix L1 blockchain platform [here](https://rubix.net/).

## Data from your activity - Within Fexr and on blockchain subnets

Fexr is will not use any of your personal information like email address or transaction details to identify you. We will only use your address to identify you. You can read more about our privacy policy [here](https://getfexr.com/privacy). We allow subnets to group your pseudo-anonymous (only your address is seen) transactions with other users to provide you with better services. This grouping is done on the Fexr platform and not on the blockchain or subnet provider.
