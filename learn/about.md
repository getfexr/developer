The Team was founded on the principles of decentralization and self-custody and has since been dedicated to building a future where users have full control over their digital assets.

One of Fexr's most exciting features is its P2P subscription services, which allow users to easily share subscription costs with others in a secure and transparent manner. With Fexr, users can create and manage shared subscriptions for a wide range of services such as streaming platforms, software, and many more. The platform also enables effortless subscription payments with built-in support for cryptocurrency payments, making it an excellent option for those who want to keep their finances decentralized.

Fexr also offers an effortless sign-in experience with its decentralized identity (DID) feature. The platform enables users to create their own DIDs, allowing them to sign in to various apps and services without providing any personal information. This provides a high level of privacy and security, while also eliminating the need for multiple usernames and passwords.

In addition to P2P subscriptions and DID, Fexr has a strong focus on self-custody. With Fexr, users have full control over their digital assets and can store them in their own wallets. This provides a high level of security and eliminates the need for third-party custody, which can be vulnerable to hacking and other types of attacks. Fexr's self-custody approach puts users in control of their digital assets and provides a safer and more secure environment for their storage and management.
