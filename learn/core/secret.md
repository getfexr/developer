## How is private key stored in your device?

Private key is stored in your device in a secure way. It is stored in a secure storage provided by your device. This secure storage is encrypted with a password that you set when you create your wallet. This password is never shared with anyone and is only stored in your device. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt the private key stored in the secure storage.

## How to backup your wallet?

You can backup your wallet by exporting the private key. This private key can be imported in any other Fexr compatible wallet application to access your wallet details. Steps to backup your wallet are as available in the settings page of your Fexr wallet app.

## How to restore your wallet?

You can restore your wallet by importing the private key instead of creating a new wallet address for your Fexr wallet. During restore you will be asked to provide the existing 4-digit pin for your wallet. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt the private key stored in the secure storage.
