# Sign in and Sign up flow with Fexr

### 1. Get Fexr

One app for everything. Fexr app function as a gateway for your identity in blockchain to be used as your identity for privacy essential applications. **Your lite wallet (Fexr app in your phone) communicates via RPC protocol to main wallet which connects to other validators and nodes in the blockchain**. Main wallets are provided as service or free by different subnet providers in Fexr community.

### 2. Create your Identity on Blockchain

First time you open the app, You will be directed to create an identity on blockchain where the **keys are generated within your device. Private key never leaves the device unless you export or backup it manually**. Then app will ask you to choose a provider to host your main wallet. Some providers allow faster syncing and transaction at a monthly fare paid anually. Subnets vary on geographical location and bandwidth. You can look into stats of all the subnets on [Rubix Explorer](https://rubixexplorer.com).


### 3. Prepare your app to validate

Once your Fexr app is ready, you can view your on-chain identity key (Decentralized IDentity or DID) available across on the Rubix blockchain network. **Third party services only need to know your on-chain identity key (DID) and public key to authenticate your signature given the payload**. This allows anyone to verify your signature and your ownership by themselves, without requiring your credentials. You may use `Sign in Fexr` option in other apps to authenticate yourself to their service. At any point, services can verify your identity by validating the signatures you signed for them via Fexr app.

### 4. Challenge and validate

This step is done by third party services you have authorised to validate your identity. **Third party services will send a challenge to your Fexr app to sign a payload**. Fexr app will sign the payload and send the signature back to the service. **The service will validate the signature by checking the public key of your identity key (DID) on the blockchain**. If the signature is valid, the service will consider you as authenticated and allow you to access their service.

**Authenticating Again**

If you have already authenticated to a service, you can use `Sign in Fexr` option in other apps to authenticate yourself to their service. At any point, services can verify your identity by validating the signatures you signed for them via Fexr app.
