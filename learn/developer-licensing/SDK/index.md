The Fexr SDK is a multi-purpose toolkit for developers keen on exploring and leveraging the power of the Rubix protocol, a low gas fee decentralized network. By utilizing the Fexr SDK, you can make full use of the Rubix network and in the future, even utilize it as a clearing network, thus negating the crippling effects of high gas fees commonly experienced in other networks.

One of the core features of the Fexr SDK is the ability to create Rubix Decentralized Identity (DID). It simplifies the process of creating and managing identities on the Rubix network, providing developers a hassle-free way of integrating DIDs into their applications. This opens up a wide spectrum of possibilities, ranging from seamless user onboarding to ensuring secured transactions.
