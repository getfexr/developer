We're thrilled to inform you that we are putting the final touches on our APIs and RPCs for external applications to integrate with Fexr. We know you are eagerly waiting to leverage our platform and we are working tirelessly to make that possible.

While we'd love to share every detail of these resources with you right now, we want to ensure that they are of the highest quality before being made public. As we all know, quality always comes before quantity.

So, to all the wise and witty developers out there, we kindly ask for your patience as we put the finishing touches on these tools. We're confident that you'll find them to be powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates and announcements from Fexr. As always, we are committed to providing you with the best tools and resources to help you succeed.

Thank you for your unwavering support and understanding.

Best regards,
The Fexr team
