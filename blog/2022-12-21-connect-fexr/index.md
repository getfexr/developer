It is becoming essential to help users connect their decentralized assets to popular web and mobile apps for cross compatible value appreciation. We used three active mainnet nodes to test the first insider version of Fluir build.

[Validator.Social](https://validator.social) is a social network subnet run by validators from different parts of the world. [Cycle360.tech](https://cycle360.tech) is an open-source supply chain tracker managed on blockchain. Both are the asset verifier and payment receiver in this real-case scenario. [Fexr.Club](https://fexr.club) is the Web3 console maintained by Fexr. A user hosted with [Fexr.Club](https://fexr.club) is transfering to a node hosted by Validator.Social, both the transactions used Sky gateway to provide hot wallet service to the sender and receiver addresses.

Rubix community quorum is used to verify transaction run between [Fexr.Club](https://fexr.club), [Cycle360.tech](https://cycle360.tech) and [Validator.Social](https://validator.social). All transactions used UI interface and does not include CLI commands or triggers to support or initiate transaction in foreground or background.

Following is the transaction details and analytics. Video included.

[fexr-js](https://npm.com/packages/fexr) is inspired from the actively maintained [fexr-flutter](https://fexr.club). This library is used to integrate RPC communications from the web application to the blockchain full nodes. [chromium-extension](https://fexr.club) is an browser exention used to get notified about realtime wallet activity, connection status and other info. All the tools including hot wallet connector is fully open-sourced and maintained by Fexr community and core developer team.
