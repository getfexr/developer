It is becoming essential to help users connect their decentralized assets to popular web and mobile apps for cross compatible value appreciation. We used three active mainnet nodes to test the first insider version of Fluir build.

Validator.Social is a social network subnet run by validators from different parts of the world. They are the asset verifier and payment receiver. Fexr.Club is the Web3 console maintained by Fexr. A user hosted with Fexr.Club is transfering to a node hosted by Validator.Social, both the transactions used Sky gateway to provide hot wallet service to the sender and receiver addresses.

Rubix community quorum is used to verify transaction run between Fexr.Club and Validator.Social.

Following is the transaction details and analytics. Video included.
