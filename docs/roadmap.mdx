We have analysed key elements required for Fexr as a business that fit together in a community driven world of artists, businesses, schools and governments adopting to user-owned internet of the future. As core team coming from Engineering specialities, we had put together strategies that allows multiple verticals to grow in their expertise. 

Along with product development, we are heavily invested in defining the problem we should be tackling in this ecosystem. Ability to work closely with the greenest blockchain period with ever growing block space has helped Fexr to push great ideas to the fast-lane development. 

You can help communicate your priorities as a user of Fexr as we plan detail of this roadmap. We believe ourselves as a team of influencers as we had to spend surprising amount of time in a host of external constituencies, including daily users, media, investors and NGOs to proactively address their concerns meshed with Fexrâ€™s interest. This shift is essential to have much greater impact as first mover in Rubix ecosystem.
