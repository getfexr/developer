## Download the Fexr - Self Custody App

Start by downloading the Fexr - Self Custody App from your device's app store. It's available for both Android and iOS devices. Simply search for "Fexr" in the Google Play Store or Apple App Store and download the app to your device.

## Open the App -  Create a New Wallet by Joining a Club 

Once you've downloaded and opened the app, you can create a new wallet by joining a Club. In Fexr, Clubs are groups created by creators. Each Club has a default network, and as a Club member, you'll generate keys for your chosen Club. Joining a Club allows you to interact with the Club ecosystem using the key generated on your self-custody wallet. Even if the Club ceases to exist, your assets remain with you. Joining a Club is easy - simply select the Club using a checkbox and continue to the next page to create keys.

## With Just a Name and Language You Speak

Creating a wallet in Fexr is simple and requires minimal information. All you need is your name and the language you speak. Fexr supports a wide range of languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Portuguese, Russian, Italian, Dutch, Turkish, Polish, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Greek.

## Full Backup Your Wallet to Another Device

Fexr provides an easy way to backup your wallet to another device. The backup option is available in the settings at the bottom of the settings page. It's a one-click setup - all you need is another mobile device with the Fexr wallet installed and waiting to receive the backup on the create wallet page.

## Hard Keys: Sign Transactions Securely with Ledger or Thin-C device

Fexr allows you to sign transactions securely using a Ledger or Thin-C device. The Thin-C device from Ensurity and Ledger Nano S have been tested and are confirmed to work with Fexr. You can connect your device on the create wallet page, and the wallet will automatically use it for key creation. Later, during transactions, you'll need to connect your device before initiating the transaction.

## Use Biometric to Unlock

For added security, Fexr allows you to unlock your wallet using biometric data. This feature is available on devices that support biometric unlock features, such as fingerprint or face recognition. This provides an additional layer of security and convenience, ensuring that only you can access your wallet.
