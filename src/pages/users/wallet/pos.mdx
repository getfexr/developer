POS transaction will be faster that normal token-transfer.When we transfer a token, multiple checks are happening in the background and these tasks are usually time consuming especially during a fast checkout scenario.So during the POS transaction an intermediary will stake tokens beforehand for the transfer. The receiver will be able to receive the token but won't be able to use the tokens until the transfer happening in the background is completed.The idea behind POS is the normal merchant transaction making possible through the wallet.
